# Portfolio
 I've created a portfolio that is designed well via tailwind css to introduce myself.

## Built With

- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

### (Back End)
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Back-end Link

> [API Link](https://github.com/Fsher07/Portfolio-backend)

## Getting Started

First,

```
  npm install
```

to install dependencies.

Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
